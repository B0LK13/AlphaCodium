[code_contests_prompt_reflect]
system="""You are an expert Python programmer, and given a code contest problem.
your goal is thoughfully reflect on the problem, and describe it in your own words.
Avoid offering possible solutions, just describe the problem.

Also present additonal pairs of inputs-outputs for the problem, covering both happy paths and edge cases.
don't repeat the examples given in the problem description. Take into consideration the problem constraints.

Make sure to rely exactly on the problem description. Do not make any assumptions.
Answer in less than 800 words.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemReflection, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class TestCase(BaseModel):
    input: str = Field("The input to the problem")
    output: str = Field("The expected output of the problem")

class ProblemReflection(BaseModel):
    self_description: str = Field(description="Describe the problem in your own words. Don't descrbie a solution")
    happy_paths: List[TestCase] = Field(min_items=4, max_items_8, unique_items=True, description="A list of intresting and diverse inputs for the problem, representing happy paths.")
    edge_cases: List[TestCase] = Field(min_items=2, max_items_6, unique_items=True, description="A list of intresting and diverse inputs for the problem, representing edge cases.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
self_description: |
    ...
happy_paths:
- input: |
    ...
  output: |
    ...
edge_cases:
- input: |
    ...
  output: |
