self_description: |
  - The problem involves a plane with an infinite number of cows at every point with integer coordinates.
  - There are n fence posts at distinct coordinates on this plane, and no three fence posts lie on the same line.
  - Gregor wants to build a triangular fence using 3 distinct fence posts.
  - A cow is considered enclosed if it is strictly inside the fence.
  - A fence is considered interesting if it encloses an odd number of cows and its area is an integer.
  - The goal is to find the number of interesting fences that Gregor can build.
  - The input consists of an integer n representing the number of fence posts, followed by n lines each containing two integers x and y representing the coordinates of a fence post.
  - The output should be a single integer representing the number of interesting fences.

possible_solutions:
- name: Brute Force
  content: |
    - Iterate over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts.
    - For each combination, calculate the area of the triangle formed by the fence posts.
    - If the area is an integer, count the number of cows enclosed by the fence.
    - If the number of enclosed cows is odd, increment a counter.
    - Return the counter as the number of interesting fences.
  labels:
  - Brute Force
  complexity: |
    - Time complexity is O(n^3) because we are iterating over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts.
    - Space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the counter and temporary variables.

    - Sort the fence posts by their x-coordinate.
    - Iterate over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts.
    - For each combination, calculate the area of the triangle formed by the fence posts.
    - If the area is an integer, use a binary search to count the number of cows enclosed by the fence.
    - If the number of enclosed cows is odd, increment a counter.
    - Return the counter as the number of interesting fences.
  labels:
  - Binary Search

  complexity: |
    - Time complexity is O(n^3 log n) because we are iterating over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts and using a binary search to count the number of enclosed cows.

- name: Geometry and Number Theory
  content: |
    - Use the properties of triangles and the Pick's theorem to calculate the area and the number of enclosed cows for each possible fence.
    - Pick's theorem states that the area of a simple polygon with vertices at integer coordinates equals the number of interior points plus half the number of boundary points minus 1.
    - Iterate over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts.

why: |
  This solution is the best because it uses a mathematical theorem (Pick's theorem) to calculate the area and the number of enclosed cows for each possible fence. This approach is more efficient than brute force or binary search because it avoids unnecessary calculations and iterations. It also ensures that the solution is accurate because Pick's theorem is a proven mathematical fact.
flow: |
  - Initialize a counter to 0.
  - Iterate over all possible combinations of 3 fence posts.
  - For each combination, calculate the area and the number of enclosed cows using Pick's theorem.
  - If the area is an integer and the number of enclosed cows is odd, increment the counter.
  - After iterating over all combinations, return the counter as the number of interesting fences.
input_output_examples_flow: |
  - For the first example, there is only 1 possible combination of 3 fence posts. The area of the triangle formed by these posts is 4 and there is 1 enclosed cow. Since the area is an integer and the number of enclosed cows is odd, the counter is incremented by 1. The final output is 1.
  - For the second example, there are 4 possible combinations of 3 fence posts. Only one of these combinations forms a triangle with an integer area and an odd number of enclosed cows. Therefore, the counter is incremented by 1 and the final output is 1.
  - For the third example, there are many possible combinations of 3 fence posts. After calculating the area and the number of enclosed cows for each combination using Pick's theorem, it is found that 29 combinations form a triangle with an integer area and an odd number of enclosed cows. Therefore, the counter is incremented by 29 and the final output is 29.
