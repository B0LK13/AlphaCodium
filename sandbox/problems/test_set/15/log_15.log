You given a code contest problem:

problem name: '1579_C. Ticks'


problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

    One possible solution is to check each cell in the grid. If the cell is black, check the cells diagonally above it to see if they form a tick of the required size.

    Another possible solution is to use a backtracking approach. Start at each black cell and try to "undo" the drawing of a tick. If you can undo a tick of the required size, continue to the next black cell. If you reach a black cell that cannot be part of a tick of the required size, return "NO" for this test case.

why: |
  This solution is the best because it is efficient and robust. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at each cell, which allows it to quickly check if the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size. It also handles all edge cases, as it checks every cell in the grid.

  - For the third example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fourth example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1 or 2, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fifth example, the DP table would show that the cell with coordinates (4, 5) cannot be part of a tick of size 2, so the output is "NO".
  - For the sixth example, the DP table would show that the top left cell cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.  
....  
  
The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

name: Dynamic Programming
content: |
  A more efficient solution might be possible using dynamic programming. Create a 2D DP table where each cell represents the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at that cell. Then iterate over the grid from bottom to top, left to right, updating the DP table based on the values of the cells diagonally above the current cell. Finally, iterate over the DP table and check if any cell has a value less than the required size. If such a cell is found, return "NO" for this test case. Otherwise, return "YES".
labels:
  - Dynamic Programming
complexity: |
  The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid. This is because each cell in the grid is checked once. The space complexity is also O(n*m), for the DP table.
why: |
  This solution is the best because it is efficient and robust. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at each cell, which allows it to quickly check if the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size. It also handles all edge cases, as it checks every cell in the grid.
flow: |
  - Initialize a 2D DP table with the same dimensions as the grid, where each cell represents the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at that cell.
  - Iterate over the grid from bottom to top, left to right.
  - For each cell, if it is black, update the DP table based on the values of the cells diagonally above the current cell.
  - After updating the DP table, iterate over it and check if any cell has a value less than the required size.
  - If such a cell is found, return "NO" for this test case. Otherwise, return "YES".
input_output_examples_flow: |
  - For the first example, the DP table would show that the cells with asterisks cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".
  - For the second example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 2 or 3, so the output is "YES".
  - For the third example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fourth example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1 or 2, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fifth example, the DP table would show that the cell with coordinates (4, 5) cannot be part of a tick of size 2, so the output is "NO".
  - For the sixth example, the DP table would show that the top left cell cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".
  - For the seventh and eighth examples, the DP table would show that some cells cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".

Your goal is to generate a valid Python code that correctly solves the problem.

guidelines:
- You must divide the code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- The code must have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity
- Always double-check the solution code, and simulate running it on the provided input-output examples. Follow the 'input_output_examples_flow' section.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.
- Make sure to follow the 'flow' and 'input_output_examples_flow' sections.

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

  This solution is the best because it is efficient and robust. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at each cell, which allows it to quickly check if the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size. It also handles all edge cases, as it checks every cell in the grid.
flow: |
  - Initialize a 2D DP table with the same dimensions as the grid, where each cell represents the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at that cell.
  - Iterate over the grid from bottom to top, left to right.
  - For each cell, if it is black, update the DP table based on the values of the cells diagonally above the current cell.
  - After updating the DP table, iterate over it and check if any cell has a value less than the required size.
  - If such a cell is found, return "NO" for this test case. Otherwise, return "YES".
input_output_examples_flow: |
  - For the first example, the DP table would show that the cells with asterisks cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".
  - For the second example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 2 or 3, so the output is "YES".
  - For the third example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fourth example, the DP table would show that all cells with asterisks can be part of a tick of size 1 or 2, so the output is "YES".
  - For the fifth example, the DP table would show that the cell with coordinates (4, 5) cannot be part of a tick of size 2, so the output is "NO".
  - For the sixth example, the DP table would show that the top left cell cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".
  - For the seventh and eighth examples, the DP table would show that some cells cannot be part of a tick of size 1, so the output is "NO".

You are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a proposed solution:

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.

The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.
'

self-reflection:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

  A more efficient solution might be possible using dynamic programming. Create a 2D DP table where each cell represents the maximum size of the tick that can be drawn with its center at that cell.

Finally, iterate over the DP table and check if any cell has a value less than the required size. If such a cell is found, return "NO" for this test case. Otherwise, return "YES".

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**

The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  The code solution is failing because it is not correctly identifying the ticks in the grid. The code is checking if a cell is black and then checking the cells diagonally below it to determine the size of the tick. However, it is not considering the cells diagonally above the cell. This is causing the code to incorrectly identify ticks and their sizes, leading to incorrect results. The code also doesn't check if a black cell is part of a tick or not. This can lead to incorrect results when there are black cells that are not part of any tick.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - First, we need to initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. This grid will be used to store the size of the tick that each cell is part of.
  - Then, we iterate over the input grid from bottom to top and from right to left. For each cell, if it is black, we check the cells diagonally below it. If these cells are black, we update the corresponding cell in the new grid with the minimum value of the cells diagonally below it plus one. This gives us the size of the tick that the cell is part of.
  - After that, we iterate over the new grid from top to bottom and from left to right. For each cell, if it is part of a tick (i.e., its value in the new grid is greater than zero), we check the cells diagonally above it. If these cells are part of a tick of the same size or larger, we update the cell in the new grid with the minimum value of the cells diagonally above it. This ensures that we correctly identify the size of the tick that each cell is part of.
  - Finally, we iterate over the new grid one more time. For each cell, if it is part of a tick and the size of the tick is less than the minimum tick size, we return "NO". If we finish iterating over the grid without finding any such cell, we return "YES".
  - This fixed flow correctly identifies the ticks in the grid and their sizes, and correctly determines whether the grid can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size.

you are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a possible Python code solution to the problem:

=====================================
problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.

The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a Python code solution.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.

The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  The problem with the code is in the function 'can_be_obtained'. It checks if any cell in the dp matrix has a value less than k, and if so, it immediately returns "NO". This is incorrect because not all cells with a '*' need to be the center of a tick. Some cells can be part of the tick but not the center. Therefore, the code should only check the cells that can be the center of a tick of size k. The cells that can be the center of a tick of size k are the cells that have a '*' and have at least k cells with '*' to the top-left and top-right diagonally.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize the dp matrix with the size of the largest possible tick that can have its center in each cell.
  - Update the dp matrix to account for the possibility of larger ticks that include smaller ticks.
  - Check if the field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size. For each cell in the grid, if it has a '*' and it can be the center of a tick of size k (it has a '*' in the dp matrix and it has at least k cells with '*' to the top-left and top-right diagonally), then continue to the next cell. If no such cell is found, return "YES". If such a cell is found, return "NO".

Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a Python code solution.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

*\color{blue}{*}**

---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  The original code failed to correctly identify whether a grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of a certain minimum size. The issue lies in the 'can_be_obtained' function, where it only checks if the size of the tick at a cell is less than the minimum size, and if so, it returns "NO". However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size. The code needs to also check if the tick at a cell is part of a larger tick. If it is part of a larger tick, then the cell should not be considered as a separate tick.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize a dynamic programming (dp) array to store the size of the tick at each cell.
  - Iterate over the grid from bottom to top and from right to left.
  - If a cell is painted black, check if it is part of a larger tick by comparing the size of the tick at the cell with the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right of the cell. If it is part of a larger tick, update the size of the tick at the cell to be the minimum of the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right of the cell plus one. Otherwise, set the size of the tick at the cell to be one.
  - After initializing the dp array, iterate over the grid again. If a cell is painted black and the size of the tick at the cell is less than the minimum size, return "NO". If a cell is painted black and the size of the tick at the cell is equal to or greater than the minimum size, check if the tick at the cell is part of a larger tick by comparing the size of the tick at the cell with the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally above and to the left and right of the cell. If it is part of a larger tick, continue to the next cell. Otherwise, return "NO".
  - If all cells have been checked and none of them caused the function to return "NO", return "YES".

=====================================
problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

The original code failed to correctly identify whether a grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of a certain minimum size. The issue lies in the 'can_be_obtained' function, where it only checks if the size of the tick at a cell is less than the minimum size, and if so, it returns "NO". However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size. The code needs to also check if the tick at a cell is part of a larger tick. If it is part of a larger tick, then the cell should not be considered as a separate tick.
'

failed_test_fixed_flow:
'
- Read the test case.
- Initialize a dynamic programming (dp) array to store the size of the tick at each cell.
- Iterate over the grid from bottom to top and from right to left.
- If a cell is painted black, check if it is part of a larger tick by comparing the size of the tick at the cell with the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right of the cell. If it is part of a larger tick, update the size of the tick at the cell to be the minimum of the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right of the cell plus one. Otherwise, set the size of the tick at the cell to be one.
- After initializing the dp array, iterate over the grid again. If a cell is painted black and the size of the tick at the cell is less than the minimum size, return "NO". If a cell is painted black and the size of the tick at the cell is equal to or greater than the minimum size, check if the tick at the cell is part of a larger tick by comparing the size of the tick at the cell with the sizes of the ticks at the cells diagonally above and to the left and right of the cell. If it is part of a larger tick, continue to the next cell. Otherwise, return "NO".
- If all cells have been checked and none of them caused the function to return "NO", return "YES".

=====================================


Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a Python code solution.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.  
....  
  
The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.
'

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  The problem with the code solution is that it only checks if the size of the tick at each cell is less than the minimum size, and if so, it returns "NO". However, it doesn't check if all the cells that are part of a tick are painted black. This means that it can incorrectly return "YES" for cases where there are white cells that should be part of a tick, or "NO" for cases where all the cells that are part of a tick are painted black.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize a 2D array dp of the same size as the grid, to store the size of the tick at each cell.
  - Iterate over the cells of the grid in reverse order. For each cell, if it is painted black, calculate the size of the tick at that cell as the minimum size of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right, plus one. Store this size in dp.
  - Iterate over the cells of the grid again. For each cell, if it is painted black and the size of the tick at that cell is less than the minimum size, return "NO".
  - After this, iterate over the cells of the grid once more. For each cell, if it is painted black, check if all the cells that should be part of the tick at that cell are also painted black. If not, return "NO".
  - If all checks pass, return "YES".

you are given a code contest problem, self-reflection on the problem, and a possible Python code solution to the problem:

=====================================
problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*

The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

We analyzed the error message, and concluded that the following went wrong:

what went wrong:
'
The problem with the code solution is that it only checks if the size of the tick at each cell is less than the minimum size, and if so, it returns "NO". However, it doesn't check if all the cells that are part of a tick are painted black. This means that it can incorrectly return "YES" for cases where there are white cells that should be part of a tick, or "NO" for cases where all the cells that are part of a tick are painted black.
'

failed_test_fixed_flow:
'
- Read the test case.
- Initialize a 2D array dp of the same size as the grid, to store the size of the tick at each cell.
- Iterate over the cells of the grid in reverse order. For each cell, if it is painted black, calculate the size of the tick at that cell as the minimum size of the ticks at the cells diagonally below and to the left and right, plus one. Store this size in dp.
- Iterate over the cells of the grid again. For each cell, if it is painted black and the size of the tick at that cell is less than the minimum size, return "NO".
- After this, iterate over the cells of the grid once more. For each cell, if it is painted black, check if all the cells that should be part of the tick at that cell are also painted black. If not, return "NO".
- If all checks pass, return "YES".

=====================================


Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows:

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').


Answer:

  The code failed to handle the edge case where the grid is of size 1x1. In this case, the code incorrectly assumes that a single cell with a '*' can be a tick of size 1. However, a tick of size 1 should have 3 cells (one center and two diagonals). So, a single cell with a '*' cannot be a tick of size 1 or more. The code should be fixed to handle this edge case correctly.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - First, add a condition to check if the grid size is 1x1. If it is, and the cell contains a '*', return 'NO' if k > 0, because a single cell cannot form a tick of size 1 or more.
  - If the grid size is not 1x1, proceed with the existing logic to determine if the grid can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size.
  - This fix will ensure that the code handles the edge case correctly and still works for all other cases.

=====================================
problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

what_went_wrong: |-
  The original code fails to handle the case where a tick cannot be formed because there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of a black cell. In the failed test case, the black cells at (1,1) and (2,2) cannot form a tick of size 1 because there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of them. The original code incorrectly assumes that a black cell can always form a tick of size 1, which is not always the case.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize a dynamic programming (dp) array to keep track of the maximum size of the tick that can be formed with each black cell as the center.
  - Iterate over the grid from bottom to top and from right to left. For each black cell, calculate the maximum size of the tick that can be formed with this cell as the center. This is done by taking the minimum of the sizes of the ticks that can be formed with the cells diagonally to the left and right of the current cell as the center, and adding 1. If the current cell is on the edge of the grid, the size of the tick that can be formed with this cell as the center is 1.
  - Iterate over the grid again. For each black cell, if the size of the tick that can be formed with this cell as the center is less than the minimum required size, return "NO".
  - If all black cells can form a tick of at least the minimum required size, return "YES".
  - The fix involves adding a check in the second iteration over the grid. For each black cell, before checking if the size of the tick that can be formed with this cell as the center is less than the minimum required size, check if there are enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of this size. If not, return "NO". This ensures that a tick can only be formed if there are enough cells diagonally to the left and right of the center cell.

=====================================
problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  
---  
*\color{blue}{*}**  
.\color{green}{*}\color{red}{*}.  
....  
  
The field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \color{blue}{blue} and \color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  
---  
*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*  
...\color{blue}{*}.  
  
The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

*\color{blue}{*}**

*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*

The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-
  ...
what_went_wrong: |-
  ...
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  ...
```
Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  - {input: '1\n3 3 1\n.*.\n*.*\n.*.\n', expected_output: 'YES\n', code_output: 'NO\n'}
what_went_wrong: |-
  The original code checks if there are enough cells diagonally to the left and right of each black cell to form a tick of size k. However, it does not consider the case where a black cell is part of a larger tick. In the failed test case, the black cells at (2,2) and (2,3) are part of a larger tick centered at (2,2), but the original code incorrectly determines that they cannot be part of a tick of size 1 because there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of them.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize a 2D array dp with the same dimensions as the grid. dp[i][j] will store the size of the largest tick that can be centered at cell (i,j).
  - Iterate over the grid in reverse order. For each black cell, calculate the size of the largest tick that can be centered at this cell by taking the minimum of the sizes of the ticks centered at the cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell in the next row, and adding 1. Store this value in dp[i][j].
  - Iterate over the grid again. For each black cell, check if the size of the largest tick that can be centered at this cell is less than k. If it is, return "NO".
  - For each black cell, check if there are enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of the size stored in dp[i][j]. If there are not, return "NO".
  - If all black cells pass the above checks, return "YES".
  - The fix is to remove the second check. This check is not necessary because we have already ensured that each black cell is part of a tick of size at least k. By removing this check, we allow black cells to be part of larger ticks.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

problem description:
'
Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.

Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).

Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 

  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 
  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 
  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. 



An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.

<image>

You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).

Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. 

The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.

Output

Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

Note

The first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.

The second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.

The field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \color{blue}{blue}, \color{red}{red} and \color{green}{green} colors: *.*.

*...*  
.*.*.  
..\color{red}{*}.*

The field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.

The field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).

In the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.

self-reflection on the problem:
'
- The problem involves a rectangular grid of cells, initially all white.
- Casimir, a character in the problem, draws ticks of different sizes on the grid. A tick is a pattern of black cells, with a center cell and a number of cells extending diagonally from the center.
- The size of a tick is defined as the number of cells extending from the center. The tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells, where d is the size of the tick.
- The problem provides a description of a grid with some cells painted black, and asks whether this grid could have been produced by Casimir drawing ticks of a certain minimum size.
- The input to the problem is a number of test cases, each consisting of the size of the grid, the minimum size of the ticks, and the grid itself.
- The output is a series of answers, one for each test case, indicating whether the given grid could have been produced by drawing ticks of the specified minimum size.

Your goal is to analyze the code and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided input example.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
'
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: List[int] = Field(description="list the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    failed_test_fixed_flow: str = Field(description="describe shortly, in bullet points, how the fixed flow will calculate the correct output, step-by-step. be specific, and emphasize the fixes, and how do they apply to the input.")
'

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |-

Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|-').

  The original code checks if a cell is part of a tick by checking if there are enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of this size. However, it fails to consider the case where a cell is part of a tick but is not the center of the tick. In the failed test case, the cell at (3, 3) is part of a tick of size 2 but is not the center of the tick. The original code incorrectly determines that this cell cannot be part of a tick of size 2 because there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of this size. Therefore, the original code incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this test case.
failed_test_fixed_flow: |-
  - Read the test case.
  - Initialize a 2D array dp of the same size as the grid. dp[i][j] will store the size of the largest tick that has its center at cell (i, j).
  - Iterate over the cells of the grid in reverse order. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if it is not on the border of the grid, set dp[i][j] to the minimum of dp[i+1][j-1] and dp[i+1][j+1] plus 1. Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to 1.
  - Iterate over the cells of the grid. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if dp[i][j] is less than k, return 'NO'. If there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of size dp[i][j], return 'NO'.
  - If all cells that are painted black are part of a tick of size at least k, return 'YES'.
  - The fix is to add a check in the second iteration over the cells of the grid. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if dp[i][j] is less than k and there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of size k, return 'NO'. This ensures that a cell can be part of a tick even if it is not the center of the tick.

- Iterate over the cells of the grid in reverse order. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if it is not on the border of the grid, set dp[i][j] to the minimum of dp[i+1][j-1] and dp[i+1][j+1] plus 1. Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to 1.
- Iterate over the cells of the grid. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if dp[i][j] is less than k, return 'NO'. If there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of size dp[i][j], return 'NO'.
- If all cells that are painted black are part of a tick of size at least k, return 'YES'.
- The fix is to add a check in the second iteration over the cells of the grid. For each cell (i, j) that is painted black, if dp[i][j] is less than k and there are not enough cells diagonally to the left and right of this cell to form a tick of size k, return 'NO'. This ensures that a cell can be part of a tick even if it is not the center of the tick.

=====================================


Using the provided analysis above, you need generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime and memory complexity.
- Always double-check the new solution code, and test it on multiple edge cases, and the provided input-output examples.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, and not only to the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality
- If the change is small, try adding comments to relevant part, explaining what was fixed

The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.
